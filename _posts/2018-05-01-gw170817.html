 CGCA Prof. David Kaplan has written an article for <a
  href="http://theconversation.com/"><span class="s1">The Conversation</span></a> with
  colleague Prof. Tara Murphy discussing the 6+ months of radio
  observations of the neutron star merger.  The optical emission faded
  very quickly, over a few days.  But the radio emission continued to
  get brighter for months, and since we could observe it during the
  day was often the only way of studying this fascinating
  subject. Read more about what we found in<br> <a
