title: CGCA - Data Center
description: Computing facilities hosted by the Center
heading: Data Center
lead: The Center for Gravitation, Cosmology and Astrophysics has its own compute cluster purpose built to search for gravitational-wave signals in large astronomical data sets. The cluster, called Nemo, is in a data center on the second floor of the Physics Building on the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee campus. This facilty was built and is operated by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration group at UW-Milwaukee. Nemo is used for development and production data analysis by members of the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration.

    <p class="lead">Nemo has 7000 processor cores which provide a peak theoretical performance
    of 56 teraFLOPS of computing power:</p>
    <ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">8 nodes running modern GPUs that can perform matrix operations and Fourier
transforms much faster than a traditional CPU. In addition, these nodes have 32
Intel Xeon E5-2650 cores running at 2.0GHz and 64GB of RAM. Deployed in Fall 2012.
<li class="list-group-item">84 nodes with 32 Intel Xeon E5-2650 cores running at 2.0GHz and 64GB of RAM. Deployed in Fall 2012.
<li class="list-group-item">160 nodes, each with 24 Intel Xeon X5650 cores running at 2.7GHz, 48 GBytes of RAM, 1000GB SATA disk. Deployed in fall 2010.
<li class="list-group-item">500 TBytes of storage (about 300 TBytes of Sun X45xx servers and 200 TBytes of inexpensive data servers).
<li class="list-group-item">The system is networked with a Force10 E1200 ethernet switch; 
all equipment is connected to a 500kVA/400 kW UPS system; four Data-Aire 26-ton air conditioning units cool the data center.

<ul> 
<li> An upgrade of Nemo was funded on August 17, 2009 by a <a href=" http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0923409">Major Research Instrumentation grant</a> from the National Science Foundation ($1,188,018) and by matching funds from UW-Milwaukee ($509,150). Approximately half of the funds were
spent on upgrades in 2010 and the remaining half in 2012. 
<li> Nemo was funded on July 20, 2004 by a <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0421416">Major Research Instrumentation grant</a> from the National Science Foundation ($1,444,972) and by matching funds from UW-Milwaukee ($446,093). UW-Milwaukee also provided the space for the data center. The anticipated lifespan of the computing nodes was 3-5 years.
