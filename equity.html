            <p class="lead"><p>In the Center for Gravitation, Cosmology and Astrophysics (CGCA), we are
committed to building and maintaining an environment that recognizes the
inherent worth and dignity of every person, fosters tolerance, sensitivity,
understanding, and mutual respect, and encourages the members of our community
to reach their full potential. Therefore, we do not tolerate discriminatory
conduct of any kind. We are dedicated to the philosophy of equality of
opportunity and treatment for all members, regardless of gender, gender
identity or expression, race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion or
religious belief, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disability, veteran
status, or any other reason not related to scientific merit.</p>

<p>Please remember that behavior choices, from clothing to language, can
constitute harassment and discourage members of under-represented groups from
pursuing careers in science.  And please work to remove the historical legacy
of sexism and other discrimination within science.</p>

<p>As part of the UWM community, the CGCA prohibits and does not tolerate
discrimination, harassment or retaliation.  We follow the <a
href="https://www4.uwm.edu/secu/docs/other/S_47.pdf">procedures</a> set out by
UWM for the investigation and remedy of such conduct.  Specifically, options
for reporting complaints are set out in Sections IV and V of that document.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://uwm.edu/womensresourcecenter/">UWM Women's Resource
Center</a>, located in the UWM Student Union, is available for people of all
genders.  If you experience any form of harassment, the Women's Resource Center
is a good first place to go for advice or just to talk about what is happening.
The Women's Resource Center does not automatically report harassment, assault,
etc, but will advise you on possible steps to take.  </p>
