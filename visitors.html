<h2>Getting to campus</h2>
<h3>By car: </h3>
<p class="tight"><i>Scenic Lake Route From All Directions:</i> From I-43 or I-94 near Downtown, take I-794 east to Lakefront exit. Proceed 3 miles north along the lake on Lincoln Memorial Dr. to the top of the hill, where Lincoln Memorial Dr. becomes E. Kenwood Blvd. and intersects with N. Lake Dr. Proceed straight (west) on Kenwood 6 blocks and park in Students' Union lot. KIRC is several blocks further west.</p>
<p><i>From the North:</i> Take I-43 south to the Capitol Dr. East exit. Proceed east on Capitol to N. Downer Ave., then south (right) on Downer five blocks to campus.</p>
<h3>Parking</h3>
<p class="tight"><a href="http://www4.uwm.edu/parking/">On-campus parking</a> is often scarce when classes are in session. Some curb parking in the neighborhood surrounding UWM is available, with restrictions. </p>

<p class="tight">Circled in pink in the map to the right is the lot right outside our building (Kenwood Interdisciplinary Research Center, KIRC). This is a pre-pay lot. You will see kiosks that will require cash or a debit/credit card to pay for total hours requested. The code for this lot (which posted) is 59006. This along with your license plate number and method of payment are all you need at the kiosk.</p>

<p class="tight">If this lot is full, you can then park in the sheltered lot at the Union. The Union is just east of our building on Kenwood Ave. Signs on Kenwood will direct you where to enter the parking garage. At the entrance, you will receive a parking stub. You then pay at the drive through exit booth upon leaving.</p>
